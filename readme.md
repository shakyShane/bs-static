###BrowserSync Control panel - playground

The purpose of this repository is allow front-end designers/developers to work on the styling elements of 
 the upcoming BrowserSync control panel.
 
It's just HTML/CSS (using sass), so feel free to pull it down and have a go at reworking the CSS.

##Browser Support
We're only targeting latest Chrome/Safari/Firefox, so use all the modern techniques you want.

##HTML Rules
It will end up being an Angular JS app, so don't edit the structure too much, you *can* add classes to elements
or add more markup where needed though.

##JS
You should not use any Javascript at all. `uilang` is used to provide the `.active` class toggles, but you should 
not edit these or add any others.

##CSS/SASS
You are free to do whatever you like with the SASS files, restructure them or even start from scratch if you like.
